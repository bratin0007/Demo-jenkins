Case Study: Implementing SDLC in a Smart Home Automation System
Project Overview


A tech company developed a Smart Home Automation System to control home appliances via a mobile
app.
1. Requirement Gathering
	What They Did:
	Talked to future users to understand their needs.
	Wrote down what the system should do.
Why It Matters:
o Clear requirements prevented misunderstandings and ensured the project met user
needs.
2. Design
What They Did:
Planned how the system would work.
Created diagrams and models of the system.
Why It Matters:
A good plan made the development process smoother and helped identify potential
problems early.
3. Implementation
What They Did:
Wrote the code for the system in small, manageable parts.
Regularly reviewed and tested the code.
Why It Matters:
Ensured that the system was built correctly and all parts worked together.
4. Testing
What They Did:
Tested each part of the system individually and together.
Had real users test the system before final release.
Why It Matters:
Found and fixed bugs, ensuring the system worked well for users.
5. Deployment
What They Did:
Gradually released the system to users.
Provided instructions and help for new users.
Why It Matters:
Smooth release ensured users could start using the system easily and without problems.
6. Maintenance
What They Did:
Monitored the system and made improvements.
Fixed any new issues that came up.
Why It Matters:
Kept the system running well and improved it over time based on user feedback.
Conclusion
Following the SDLC phases helped the tech company build a high-quality Smart Home Automation
System that met user needs, was reliable, and could be easily improved in the future. Each phase was
crucial for the project's success.
