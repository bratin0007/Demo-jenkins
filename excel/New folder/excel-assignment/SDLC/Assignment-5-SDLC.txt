Assignment 2: Produce a comparative infographic of TDD, BDD, and FDD methodologies. Illustrate
their unique approaches, benefits, and suitability for different software development contexts. Use
visuals to enhance understanding.




Test-Driven Development (TDD)




TDD Cycle Steps
	1.Write a Test - Start with a specific test for new 	functionality.
	2.Run Tests (Fail) - Ensure the new test fails initially.
	3.Write Code to Pass - Write just enough code to pass the 	test.
	4.Run Tests (Pass) - Run all tests to ensure they pass.
	5.Refactor Code - Clean up the code without changing 	functionality.
	6.Repeat - Continue the cycle for each feature or fix.
    Benefits of TDD
	1.Bug Reduction - Early defect detection.
	2.Better Design - Modular, decoupled code.
	3.Documentation - Tests as living documentation.
	4.Confidence in Changes - Safe refactoring and feature 	addition.
	5.Continuous Integration - Supports automated testing.





Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
BDD Cycle Steps
	1. Define Behavior - Write user stories in plain language.
	2. Convert to Test Scenarios - Translate stories into 	executable tests.
	3. Run Tests (Fail) - Ensure new scenarios fail initially.
	4. Implement Code - Write code to fulfill the behavior.
	5. Run Tests (Pass) - Execute tests to ensure they pass.
	6. Refactor Code - Clean up the code while keeping 	functionality intact.
	7. Repeat - Continue the cycle for each user story.
    Benefits of BDD
	1. Enhanced Collaboration - Improves communication between 	stakeholders.
	2. Clear Requirements - Ensures understanding of 	requirements.
	3. Reduced Misunderstandings - Aligns development with 	business goals.
	4. Living Documentation - User stories and tests serve as 	documentation.
	5. Improved Quality - Focuses on user behavior and 	expectations.
Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
    FDD Process Steps
	1. Develop Overall Model - Create a high-level domain model.
	2. Build Feature List - Identify and prioritize features.
	3. Plan by Feature - Assign features to iterations.
	4. Design by Feature - Design feature-specific solutions.
	5. Build by Feature - Implement features in small 	iterations.
    Benefits of FDD
	1. Scalability - Effective for large-scale projects.
	2. Feature Focus - Prioritizes delivering customer value.
	3. Predictable Outcomes - Clear progress tracking with 	features.
	4. Improved Team Productivity - Structured and efficient 	workflow.
	5. Regular Updates - Frequent delivery of working features.
    Key Differences Between TDD, BDD

	Test-Driven Development (TDD)
		Focus: Writing tests before code to ensure 			functionality and drive design.
