Scrum Master: Good morning, everyone! Let's get started with our daily standup. We'll follow our usual
format: What did you work on yesterday? What will you work on today? Any blockers? Let's begin with
Rahul.
Rahul (Frontend Developer):
Yesterday: I finished the profile picture upload functionality and started working on the UI for updating
personal information.
Today: I'll complete the UI for updating personal information and start implementing form validation.
Blockers: No blockers currently.
Scrum Master: Great progress, Rahul. Next, Virat.
Virat (Backend Developer):
Yesterday: I worked on the backend API for managing user roles and permissions.
Today: I plan to finish the API and start integrating it with the frontend.
Blockers: I'm facing a challenge with the role-based access control logic. It's taking longer than expected.
Scrum Master: Thanks for sharing, Virat. Let's address that after the standup. Now, Michel.
Michel (QA Tester):
Yesterday: I completed testing the profile picture upload feature. Found a few minor bugs and logged
them.
Today: I'll test the personal information update functionality once Rahul completes it.
Blockers: No blockers from my side.
Scrum Master: Excellent, Michel. David, you're up next.
David (DevOps Engineer):
Yesterday: I worked on setting up the continuous integration pipeline for our new features.
Today: I'll finish the CI pipeline setup and ensure it's running smoothly.
Blockers: None at the moment.
Scrum Master: Good to hear, David. Finally, Emma.
Emma (Product Owner):
Yesterday: I reviewed the user stories and updated the acceptance criteria based on the feedback we
received.
Today: I'll be prioritizing the backlog and preparing for the next sprint planning session.
Blockers: No blockers.
Scrum Master: Thanks, Emma. Now, addressing Virat's challenge with the role-based access control
logic, does anyone have experience with this or suggestions for resources that might help?
Rahul: I faced a similar issue in a previous project. Virat, I can pair with you after the standup to help
debug the logic. We could also look into some best practice documentation on role-based access control
to see if we're missing anything.
Virat: That sounds great, Rahul. Thank you!
Scrum Master: Excellent teamwork! Let's ensure we stay on track with our sprint goals. If there's nothing
else, let's wrap up. Remember, if any other issues arise, feel free to reach out. Have a productive day,
everyone!
