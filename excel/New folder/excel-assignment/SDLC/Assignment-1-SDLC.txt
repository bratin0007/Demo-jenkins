Assignment 1: SDLC Overview - Create a one-page infographic that outlines the SDLC phases
(Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment), highlighting the importance of each
phase and how they interconnect



1. Requirements

	Objective: Define what the software should do.
	Key Activities:
		Gather requirements from stakeholders
		Document functional and non-functional requirements.
		Analyze feasibility
	Importance: Ensures a clear understanding of what is needed, preventing scope creep and
	miscommunication.

2. Design	
	Objective: Plan the software structure.	
	Key Activities:
		Create architectural design.
		Design database schema.
		Develop detailed technical specifications
	Importance: Provides a blueprint for development, ensuring all components will work together
	seamlessly.

3. Implementation

	Objective: Write the code and build the software.
	Key Activities:
		Develop and integrate modules.
		Follow coding standards.
		Perform initial debugging.
	Importance: Translates designs into a functional software product.
4. Testing

	Objective: Ensure the software is defect-free.
	Key Activities:
		Conduct unit, integration, and system testing.
		Perform user acceptance testing (UAT).
		Identify and fix bugs.
	Importance: Verifies that the software meets requirements and works as intended, ensuring
	quality and reliability.


5. Deployment
	Objective: Release the software to users.
	Key Activities:
		Plan and execute deployment.
		Provide user training and documentation.
		Monitor and maintain post-deployment.
	Importance: Delivers the product to users and ensures it operates smoothly in the live
	environment.


Interconnection of Phases
	1.Sequential Flow: Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a structured development
	process.
	2.Feedback Loops: Continuous feedback between phases for adjustments and improvements.
	3.Iterative Process: Revisiting and refining phases as 	needed to enhance the software quality.
