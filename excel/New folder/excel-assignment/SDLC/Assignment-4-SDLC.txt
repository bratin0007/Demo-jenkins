Assignment 1: Create an infographic illustrating the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process. Highlight steps like writing tests before code, benefits such as bug reduction, and how it fosters software reliability. 

Test-Driven Development (TDD) 
Steps of Test Driven Development

Write Test Cases

Illustration: Programmer writing test cases before writing actual code.
Caption: "Write failing test cases based on desired behavior."
Run Tests

Illustration: Test automation tool executing the written test cases.
Caption: "Run tests to ensure they fail as expected."
Write Code

Illustration: Programmer coding to make the failing test cases pass.
Caption: "Write minimal code to make failing tests pass."
Run Tests Again

Illustration: Test automation tool running the tests again after code changes.
Caption: "Ensure all tests pass after code modifications."
Refactor Code

Illustration: Programmer refactoring code to improve design without changing behavior.
Caption: "Refactor code to improve clarity and maintainability."
Repeat

Illustration: Circular arrow indicating the iterative nature of the TDD process.
Caption: "Repeat the cycle for each new feature or code change."
Section 2: Benefits of Test Driven Development

 
Benefits of TDD
 1. Bug Reduction - Early defect detection.
 2. Better Design - Modular, decoupled code.
 3. Documentation - Tests as living documentation.
 4. Confidence in Changes - Safe refactoring and feature addition. 
5. Continuous Integration - Supports automated testing
